HOW TO CREATE LEVELPACK

-	Create folder under "res://Levels/" with your username as a title
-	Add a folder under this folder named "Microgames"

-	Create a new scene. Simply use the + at the top of the editor.
-	From the "res://Levels/" folder, drag the gamepack.tscn into the 2D editor. 
-	This is the base for a levelpack. Save it to your folder.
-	Add this levelpack to the variable of the gamepack_list.tscn under the same Levels folder.

After you add your levelpack to the folder, you should no longer need to do anything outside your
personal folder.


MICROGAMES
-	Each microgame will be its own scene. It will operate almost entirely just fine on its own.
-	To create a microgame, simply create a new scene, (just press + at the top)
-	Then add the microgame.tscn from the "res://Levels/" into the 2D editor.
-	Create a folder within your Microgames folder to save this scene to. Keeping your microgames in seperate folders helps keep you organized.
-	Each microgame has a "won" boolean. Set this to true or false during the game to indicate success or failure.
	-	Example: A game where you balance an object could be true, then become false if the object falls.
	-	Example: 


CONTROLS
-	Please only use the following as inputs for your microgames
		* SPACEBAR ("SPACE")
		* LeftMouseButton ("CLICK")
		* Mouse position and movement
		* Arrows ("UP", "LEFT", "RIGHT", "DOWN")
-	These will have keybindings so you can change them


MICROGAME COUNTER
-	When 8 beats are left, a counter will appear for your microgame. This is a child of your Microgame scene.
-	You should add a unique SpriteFrames to this, consisting of 8 frames.
-	Remove the loop and set the FPS to 2
-	Its functionality will be handled by the Microgame
